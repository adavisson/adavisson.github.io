    For my first post, I am going to give a little background about myself, and let you know why I decided to take this course.
		
		I graduated from Clemson University in 2014 with a BS in Computer Information Systems. I took a good number of programming courses while there, and the languages we used mostly were C/C++ and Java. After graduating, I got into Systems Administration, which I have been doing for the past 5 years. While I have enjoyed managing and building systems for various sized companies, I have gradually found the work less and less fulfilling.
		
		After some reflection, I realized that the parts of my job that I really enjoyed were the parts that worked with building and scaling things with code. Ansible is the main technology I got to use for this, and it was awesome. I was also searching for something where I could build and work on things that are more visible and tangible, and that started leading me towards web development.
		
		I recently had a friend who completed the self-paced course through Flatiron, and she had great success with it. I knew that if I was going to take the leap and make a career change, that I would need a structured curriculum and accountability. So here I am, excited for a new adventure in something that I truly enjoy doing.
		
		Through my first two weeks in the course, I have been greatly encouraged by the helpful community and well thought out lessons. I have very much enjoyed working through all of the lessons and labs, and it has all just reaffirmed my decision to change my career path. I look forward to working through this course and continuing my journey.
