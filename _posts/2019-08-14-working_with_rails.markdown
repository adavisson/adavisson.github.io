I have thoroughly enjoyed working through this course and I love seeing how everything is building off of what I have learned previously.

So far, Rails has been the coolest section. Being able to see all of the concepts that I have learned through Sinatra and previous sections, be 'magically' implemented by Rails is awesome! I think one of my favorites things that I have learned so far is routes, and the way Rails takes care of them is really fun and easy to work with. Also, I didn't think I would use the generators that much because it just seemed like another thing to remember, but I am finding them incredibly useful and powerful.

I started to think back at when I first started this class and how if I were to look at one of these Rails projects, I would have been completely overwhelmed. But in just a few months, I have learned a ton and I feel completely comfortable with all of the concepts, file structure, erb tags, etc. I have just been really amazed at what I have been able to pick up and the pace at which I have been able to do it.
