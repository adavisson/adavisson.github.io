Now that I am starting to go through the job interview process, I am trying to do everything I can to be prepared. One suggestion I got was to go through some basic definitions over and over so that I would be able to readily answer them in phone screenings. At first I started writing all of these questions and definitions in a Google Doc, but I thought it would be a good project to create a website that would use "flashcards" to help me study.

Study Buddy is a single page React application, that goes over various topics that might come up in screenings or interviews for Software Engineering positions. This project was pretty straight-forward, and I was able to hack it together rather quickly. It uses flexbox so the UI looks great on desktop or mobile. The one thing that was different for this project than previous projects for me was that I used Semantic UI instead of Boostrap. Documentation for both is very easy to find and implementing them are very straight forward. The one thing that frustrated me was trying to find an module like 'Navbar' in Bootstrap. 'Menu' worked fine, but I definitely prefer the look and feel of 'Navbar' more.

If you would like to use Study Buddy to help you study you can find it [here](http://study-buddy.andydavisson.com). Also, if you have any suggestions on questions or subjects to add just let me know.
